Pylons
======

The Pylons web framework is aimed at making webapps and large programmatic
website development in Python easy. Several key points:

* A framework to make writing web applications in Python easy

* Utilizes a minimalist, component-based philosophy that makes it easy to
  expand on

* Harness existing knowledge about Python

Knowing Python makes Pylons easy
---------------------------------

Pylons makes it easy to expand on your knowledge of Python to master Pylons for
web development. Using a MVC style dispath, Python knowledge is used at various
levels:

* The Controller is just a basic Python class, called for each
  request. Customizing the response is as easy as overriding __call__ to make
  your webapp work how you want.

* Mako templating compiles directly to Python byte-code for speed and utilizes
  Python for template control rather than creating its own template syntax for
  "for, while, etc"
